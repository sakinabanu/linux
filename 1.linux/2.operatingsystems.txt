COMPUTER SYSTEM :

The computer system totally works on the Hardware and software. Every hardware understands only the binary language to do task. Therefore, software builts a program which is converted to the low level language which is binary language to do actions and share Information easily.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATING SYSTEM :

It is a system that coperates the complete and loads applications to run on it They are severd operating Systems like: Windows, Linux, Mac OS etc. An operating system is divide into two types :
1) Command line
2) Graphical User Interface (GUI)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMAND LINE :
The command lie is und to work on the application and processes on a computer. This accepts only code language to progress further.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GUI : 
This is used in now-a-days computers as an easy option to operate computers other than command line. This builds an application into an icon in which we can operate and acess the data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TWO WAYS AN OPERATING SYSTEM CAN WORK :

1) It works as an main Operating System.

	_________________________________________________
	|						|
	|	WINDOWS IS MAIN PROCESSER WHICH		|
	|	 RUNS OTHER PROCESSES IN IT.		|
	|			 ____________________	|
	|			|		     |  |
	|			|    LINUX WORKS     |  |
	|			|   UNDER WINDOWS    |  |
	|			|     PROCESSOR      |	|
	|			|      WITH WSL      |  |
	|			|____________________|  |
	|_______________________________________________|


2) It works as an sub OS that is workinng as a side OS partially inside a main OS.

	
	 _______________________________________________________
	| 							|
	|   BOTH PROCESSORS WORK EQUALLY ON COMPUTER		|
	| _________________________   _________________________ |
	||			   | |			       ||
	||	   WINDOWS         | | 	        LINUX 	       ||
	||-------------------------| |-------------------------||
	||     WORKS ON A PART     | |   WORKS ON OTHER PART   ||
	||	  OF SYSTEM        | |	     OF SYSTEM	       ||
	||_________________________| |_________________________||	
	|     THEY WORK SEPERATELY LIKE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS	|
	|              AND HAVE NO CONNECTION THERE 		|
	|_______________________________________________________|
	

So, here we are using wsl-ubuntu server as a sub server in Windows Operating system.
Later, we will use virtual machine to run two servers, on a single device and reinstall an ununtu server as a complete processor thet runs on system ussing half space of device.

UBUNTU :

Ubuntu is a linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software ubuntu is officially released in three edition:
	• Desktop : for casual use on remote devices.
	• Server : for all time running and accessing purpose.
	• Core : for always keep the sites and servers live.

It is used for cloud computing, servers, desktop, and Internet of Things (IOT) devices.
